      medicinal products, thereby setting the basic statutory requirements necessary for the protection of the public health.
      Under the Medicines Act, a medicinal product refers to a substance that is administered to humans for a medicinal purpose
      or used as an ingredient in the preparation of a substance to be administered to humans for a medicinal purpose.
      'Medicinal purposes' refer to treating or inducing anesthesia, preventing disease, diagnosing or determining the 
      extent or degree of a disease, contraception, or to prevent or interfere with the normal operation of a physiological state or condition.
      For the purposes of the Medicines Act numerous orders and regulations were enacted, e.g. Medicines (Advertisement) (Exemption) Order,
      Medicines (Export Licence for Psychotropic Substances) Regulations and Medicines (Labelling of Chinese Proprietary Medicines) Regulations.
